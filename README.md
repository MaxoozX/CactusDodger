## Game presentation

The game is very simple, you have to dodge the cactus.
To jump you can press the space bar.
You can use a double jump but it will cost you 1 score point.
The fire cactus can't be dodged without a double jump.

## Compiling

To compile the project, run the `compile.sh` file.
You must have the SDL2 library (on linux: libsdl2-dev & libsdl2-image-dev)
